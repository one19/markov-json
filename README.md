### What is this?

Hi there. I hate all the JS markov chain generaters out there. Yes. all of them. Hate them.

I'm shaving a yak over here; making a new one that'll be pretty extendable and pretty fast, and pretty much pure JS with no *(or at least very few)* deps. It's under heavy changes at the moment. I'll publish a `0.0.1` version with a subsequently descriptive readme when it's there.
